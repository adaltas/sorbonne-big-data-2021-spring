## Introduction to Python
### Demo and exercises

### Prerequisites

Connect to the Adaltas cloud cluster using OpenVPN. Follow the tutorials:
- https://www.adaltas.cloud/en/docs/onboarding/vpn/
- https://www.adaltas.cloud/en/docs/onboarding/ssh/

### Goals

Learn the Python fundamentals:
- Variables and data structures,  
- For and while loop
- Conditional statements
- Defining functions

### Connection to Zeppelin

- Navigate to http://zep-1.au.adaltas.cloud:9995 with your browser
- Log in using your Adaltas cloud credentials

- Create a notebook and name it as follows: `sorbonne-2021/firstname-lastname/python_intro`
(e.g. `sorbonne-2021/petra-kaferle/python_intro`). This should create your folder in `sorbonne-2021/`.
- Initialize your interpreter by running `%pyspark` in  the first cell.

### During the session

During the classes, go through the notebook and test the code along with the teacher. At the end, you will do exercises independently, with the help of the demo code.
